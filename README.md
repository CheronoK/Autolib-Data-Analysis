# Independent-Project
This repository contains week 4 independent project in which we were required to clean, analyze and draw conclusions from data provided from a car sharing company. The cleaning and analysis was done in a python notebook using pandas.
# Data Analysis
I started by importing pandas library as it is essential in this analysis.
The provided data was loaded as a csv file.
The data was then accessed in order to figure out null values.
# Data Cleaning
Irrelevant columns were then removed
The columns with null values were also removed.
Removed all the spaces from the column names and replaced them with underscores. Also removed fullstops on the column names.
Changed the names of the columns to lower case to make work easier while writing code.
# Constructing and exporting new data
New columns needed for he analysis were constructed.
The new cleaned data was also exported as a csv file.
# Analysis
After keenly analysing data and answering given research questions, analysis was made and results is given in the python notebook. The notebook can be found here - https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GIvvaBl5NF1EHkr1RyiXUr6TGue8Ybxh
